## Observations on team and player data

Data from uefa website:  http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/statistics/

- All team-related data had the exact same rows and columns.  
- The team-related data could be easily amalgamated into a single tab in an excel spreadsheet

- On the other hand, the player-related data could not be easily amalgamated into a single
tab in a spreadsheet as the number of rows (players) varied from one measurement to another
- e.g. total number of players in tournament is 453 players
- e.g. some of the measurement excluded players who had "0" in all columns/measurements
- Action:  will need to manually input data into the master player_data spreadsheet
